## Project Overview

We are an emerging startup specializing in outdoor experiences. For our latest initiative, we want to create a website for a trekking tour guide from Lombok, Indonesia, who offers trekking tours on Mount Rinjani. To evaluate our candidate's skills, we would like her to develop the frontend of this website. The website should be informative and appealing, presenting the various tour options and information about the guide to potential customers.

## Setting

The trekking tour guide from Lombok, Indonesia, offers adventurous tours on Mount Rinjani. The tours offered include:

- A 2-day/1-night tour
- A 3-day/2-night tour

The website should inform potential customers about these tours, inspire them, and provide all the necessary information to consider booking a tour.

## Sections to Design

The candidate should design the following 3 sections for the website:

1. **Hero Section**:
   - An engaging image or video of Mount Rinjani.
   - A short welcome message and a call to action, e.g., "Explore Mount Rinjani."
   - Call to action button: Jump to offers.

2. **Tour Offers**:
   - An overview of the tours offered (2-day/1-night tour and 3-day/2-night tour).
   - For each tour: title, short description, tour highlights, duration, and price.
   - A "Learn more" or "Book now" button for each tour.

3. **About the Guide** (optional):
   - A brief introduction of the guide with a photo.
   - Background information, experience, and special qualifications.
   - Personal quotes or customer testimonials.

## Technical Requirements
- **Frameworks**: React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Data Fetching**: Data should be fetched via JSON files from a backend. The backend does not need to be created; it is only expected that the data will be integrated via API calls.
- **Data Source**: The data should be fetched directly from [this JSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tkrpn/rinjani-content/main/data.json).
- **Image Integration**: Photos are stored in a backend and can be easily integrated via public URLs.
- **Responsive Design**: The website must look good and be usable on various devices (desktop, tablet, smartphone).
- **Clean and Well-Commented Code**: The code should be well-structured and understandable to facilitate easy maintenance and further development.
- **Shared in Private Repository**: The code should be committed and pushed to a private repository on GitHub/GitLab.
- **Use fitting Images**: Use images found on the internet that are fitting for the specific purpose.

## Data Source
Data should be fetched from [this JSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tkrpn/rinjani-content/main/data.json).
